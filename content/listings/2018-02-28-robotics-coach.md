#### About the Program

The Robotics Program is designed to use LEGO and WeDo 2.0 software to motivate, excite and engage children about STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects at an early age through meaningful problem-based and hands-on cooperative learning that promotes computational thinking.
