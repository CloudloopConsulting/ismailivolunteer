#### About the Program

SEED stands for Supportive Environments and Experiences for Development. Join us for monthly small group sessions with trained facilitators and other parents and families of young children where together we will exchange and share parenting stories and knowledge, learn from trained facilitators and engage in activities with our children in a social environment, access resources and information geared specifically to the development age of our children, meet other parents and families, and build friendships and support networks and share ideas on how to instil Shia Ismaili Muslim values in our children from the earliest years of life

#### The Role

The volunteer will work with the SEED team to ensure all centres are organized, expenses are submitted on time with required paperwork, all centres have materials and equipment and that evaluation data is submitted on-time and is accurate. The volunteer will have to be in contact with all centre coordinators via phone and e-mail.

#### About You

Organized, ability to communicate effectively, efficient, and committed.
