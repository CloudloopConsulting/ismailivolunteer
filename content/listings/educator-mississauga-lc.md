#### About the Program

The Learning Centres (LC) are a network of centres with the mandate of helping Ismaili students get educational support and build their foundational skills in numeracy and literacy.

The Enhanced Learning Centres (ELC) particularly focus on students that are struggling with numeracy and literacy in day school classrooms. Students performing at a B-level or below (or equivalent) should be attending the ELCs.

Varying by centre, Learning Centres are open to students from senior kindergarten to grade 8, in nine centres across the GTA.
