#### About the Program

The Learning Centres (LC) are a network of centres with the mandate of helping Ismaili students get educational support and build their foundational skills in numeracy and literacy.

The Enhanced Learning Centres (ELC) particularly focus on students that are struggling with numeracy and literacy in day school classrooms. Students performing at a B-level or below (or equivalent) should be attending the ELCs.

Varying by centre, Learning Centres are open to students from senior kindergarten to grade 8, in nine centres across the GTA.

#### The Role

Managers are required to administer the program, support the teachers and volunteers, and ensure the students have an adequate learning environment to thrive and grow. The role will work with the existing co-manager. We are looking to train the new manager from now until the end of June, after which the manager will assume full responsibility with one other co-manager for the 2017-2018 academic year.
